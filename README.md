travetto: Auth Express
===

This is a primary integration for the [`Auth`](https://github.com/travetto/auth) module.  This is another level of scaffolding allowing for any [`express`](https://expressjs.com)-based authentication framework to integrate.  

The integration with the [`Express`](https://github.com/travetto/express) touches multiple levels. Primarily:
* Security information management
* Patterns for auth framework integrations
* Route declaration
* Passport integration

## Security information management
When working with framework's authentication, the user information is exposed via the `express` ```Request``` object.  The auth functionality is exposed on the request as the property `auth`.
```typescript
declare module "express" {
	export interface Request {
		auth: {
      context: AuthContext<any>; 
      authenticated: boolean;
      unauthenticated: boolean;
      checkPermissions(include: string[], exclude: string[]): boolean;
      login(providers: symbol[]): Promise<AuthContext<any>|undefined>;
      logout: Promise<void>;
    }
	}
}
```
This allows for any filters/middleware to access this information without deeper knowledge of the framework itself.  Also, for performance benefits, the auth context is stored in the user session as a means to minimize future lookups. Since we are storing the entire principal in the session, it is best to keep the principal as small as possible.

## Patterns for Integration
Every external framework integration relies upon the ```AuthProvider``` contract.  This contract defines the boundaries between both frameworks and what is needed to pass between. As stated elsewhere, the goal is to be as flexible as possible, and so the contract is as minimal as possible:
```typescript
export class AuthProvider<U> {
  async logout(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void>;
  async login(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<AuthContext<U> | undefined>;
  serialize(ctx: AuthContext<U>): string;
  async deserialize(serialized: string): Promise<AuthContext<U>>;
}
```
By default, logout does nothing, as the `express` session cleanup will generally suffice.  Additionally, the ```serialize```/```deserialize``` functionality default to ```JSON.stringify```/```JSON.parse``` respectively.  These can be overridden as needed, but sensible defaults help to minimize the friction between pieces.

The only required method to be defined is the ```login``` method.  This takes in an `express` ```Request``` and ```Response```, and is responsible for:
* Returning an ```AuthContext``` if authentication was successful
* Throwing an error if it failed
* Returning undefined if the authentication is multi-staged and has not completed yet

A sample auth provider would look like:
```typescript
class DumbProvider extends AuthProvider<any> {
  async login(req: Request, res: Response) {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    if (username === 'test' && password === 'test') {
      return {
        id: 'test',
        permissions: new Set(),
        principal: {
          username: 'test'
        }
      };
    } else {
      throw new Error(ERR_INVALID_CREDS);
    }
  }
}
```

The provider must be registered with a custom symbol to be used within the framework.  At startup, all registered ```AuthProvider```s are collected and stored for reference at runtime, via symbol.

```typescript
export const FB_AUTH = Symbol('facebook');

export class AppConfig {
  @InjectableFactory(FB_AUTH)
  static facebookProvider(): AuthProvider<any> {
    return new AuthProvider(...);
  }
}
```

The symbol ```FB_AUTH``` is what will be used to reference providers at runtime.  This was chosen, over ```class``` references due to the fact that most providers will not be defined via a new class, but via an `@InjectableFactory` method.

## Route Declaration
Like the ```AuthService```, there are common auth patterns that most users will implement. The framework has codified these into decorators that a developer can pick up and use.

* ```@Authenticated``` provides `express` middleware that will authenticate the user as defined by the specified providers, or throw an error if authentication is unsuccessful.
```typescript
@Controller('/auth')
export class Auth {

  @Get('/facebook')
  @Authenticate(FB_AUTH)
  async fbLogin() {}

  ...

}
```
* ```@Authenticated``` and ```@Unauthenticated``` will simply enforce whether or not a user is logged in and throw the appropriate error messages as needed.
```typescript
@Controller('/auth')
export class Auth {
  ...

  @Get('/self')
  @Authenticated()
  async getSelf(req: Request) {
    return req.auth.context;
  }

  @Post('/logout')
  @Unauthenticated()
  async logout(req: Request, res: Response) {
    await req.auth.logout();
  }
```

## Passport
